ACCESSABILITY CONSIDERATIONS

Question 1B:

I have used appropriate header on all pages. H1 through to H4 when required. 

All images have appropriate ALT TEXT should they not appear.

Colour chosen is minimalistic and contrasting. this makes it simple to read while being astheticly pleaseing.. the font chosen is also simple to read, and will revert back to default text if the google page/link is not accessable. 

simple colour has been used. for links (other then then navigation tabs) these have been left as standard "hyperlink blue" to allow familiarity to the site, and where these links can be found. 

The form has been created, using its own style sheet. unforuntitly i did not see the form requirments - use google forms - this form uses standard html input, and can be used on any devise. 

all links can be accessed using the TAB and ENTER keys. There is no need to use a mouse. 

using the correct semantic HTML elements are sometimes better then using ARIA, especially with HTML 5

Question 2B:

This website is viewable on all browsers and mobile devices. fgor any screen under 500px, it will re-format itself to allow the screen to better show all the information on the pages. this done by using the @media function. 

some changes include: 
 - the navigation menu goes from horizaontal alingment to vertical aligment
 - the maximum width goes from 960 to 500 px.
 - 100% of the mobile screen will be used
 - images are automatically resized for the size of the screen. future iterations would have them repaced with smaller images allowing for fast load time. 
 - when yhe page is resized by the user, all items ont he page scale. this was doen by using % not px measurments in relation to the page width. 
 - there is not need to scroll hoizontally. All aspects of the web page can be seen by scrolling vertically, and it adjusts its size to fit on a miobile devise vertically also. 
 - no need to pinch or zoom any font for them to be seen oin mobile.
