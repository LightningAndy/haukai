ACCESSABILITY CONSIDERATIONS

Question 1B:

I have used appropriate header on all pages. H1 through to H4 when required. 

All images have appropriate ALT TEXT should they not appear.

Colour chosen is minimalistic and contrasting. this makes it simple to read while being astheticly pleaseing.. the font chosen is also simple to read, and will revert back to default text if the google page/link is not accessable. 

simple colour has been used. for links (other then then navigation tabs) these have been left as standard "hyperlink blue" to allow familiarity to the site, and where these links can be found. 

The form has been created, using its own style sheet. unforuntitly i did not see the form requirments - use google forms - this form uses standard html input, and can be used on any devise. It uterlises https://formspree.io/ to process the information to thehaukai@gmail.com where bookings can be added to the calender if required.   

all links can be accessed using the TAB and ENTER keys. There is no need to use a mouse. 

using the correct semantic HTML elements are sometimes better then using ARIA, especially with HTML 5

Question 2B:

This website is viewable on all browsers and mobile devices. for any screen under 500px, it will re-format itself to allow the screen to better show all the information on the pages. this done by using the @media function. 

some changes include: 
 - the navigation menu goes from horizaontal alingment to vertical aligment
 - the maximum width goes from 960 to 500 px.
 - 100% of the mobile screen will be used
 - images are automatically resized for the size of the screen. future iterations would have them repaced with smaller images allowing for fast load time. 
 - when yhe page is resized by the user, all items ont he page scale. this was doen by using % not px measurments in relation to the page width. 
 - there is not need to scroll hoizontally. All aspects of the web page can be seen by scrolling vertically, and it adjusts its size to fit on a miobile devise vertically also. 
 - no need to pinch or zoom any font for them to be seen oin mobile. 

Question 2C:
 - There is no 2G setting on my version of google chrome, and i was unable to find an extension that would be added to it. You will see in the list of screen shot a Slow 3G version, which was the most limiting one i was able to test the site on. 
 - i also chose not to have pages minified, as the only pages i could find on google removed all of my comments from pages, meaning i was left with no explination of what does what. I understand that this is one of the purposes of a minifed code, however it does not make it easy to work with as an inexperienced programmer/code writer.  

Question 2D:

HTTP caching imporves website performance only if the website has previously been visited. this allows for the storage of larger items, such as video or images to be stored more locally, speeds up retreval, and therfore and increase performance time. 

Contect delivery networks hosted by large multinational corperations will allow for the speeding up of the internet, and the responsiveness of sites. this can be done by storing static resources on fast laoding servers all over the will allow for the server lag and higher speeds. These are now ofter SSD loaded servers, provding faster speeds then traditional HHD storage. 

both HTTP caching and contect delivery networks will increase network speed and response times!
