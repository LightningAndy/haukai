ACCESSABILITY CONSIDERATIONS

I have used appropriate header on all pages. H1 through to H4 when required. 

All images have appropriate ALT TEXT should they not appear.

Colour chosen is minimalistic and contrasting. this makes it simple to read while being astheticly pleaseing.. the font chosen is also simple to read, and will revert back to default text if the google page/link is not accessable. 

simple colour has been used. for links (other then then navigation tabs) these have been left as standard "hyperlink blue" to allow familiarity to the site, and where these links can be found. 

The form has been created, using its own style sheet. unforuntitly i did not see the form requirments - use google forms - this form uses standard html input, and can be used on any devise. 

all links can be accessed using the TAB and ENTER keys. There is no need to use a mouse.
